title: Writing articles with LaTeX

I had to write a quite short article for school a few weeks ago. I'm used to
write my homework with Apple's Pages, with always the same template I've built
once. But this time, I wanted to change the look of my document, yet there is
a bug I can't manage to solve with Pages: I have a paragraph, it has
a background color, inner margins, and I want borders on its top and its
bottom. I don't know why, but borders stop **before** the inner
margin.

I've eared about an
amazing, powerful, word processor called LaTeX. Well, OK why not. I decided to
give it a try. After several <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">cups
of </span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">coffee</span> hours
I had finally wrote my document with my own custom style document class.
 In my opinion, LaTeX is nice, nevertheless it has a major drawback: it is
**old**. Oh, I like writing text with non-WYSIWYG programs,
I don't really like icons, and the less my macbook does the best it runs. But
LaTeX, because of its age needs a serious cleaning. There are dozen of packages
(some kind of pluggable pieces of code for your document) which does nearly the
same things, but not exactly. So you need 2 or 3 of them to reach your goal.
More over, I think something like CSS is far more efficient (okay, it has some
drawbacks (e.g. IE) that LaTeX doesn't but...).  If you are curious and
want to see what I've done, here are my files:

<div style="text-decoration: line-through;">
 - LaTeX source
 - PDF render
 - The picture which is used in the document
 - My custom document class
</div>

Oh, and I'm still looking for a work around for my Pages
problem!
