I'm a regular reader of [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/). I've just read
"[Apple, There's Pornography On My iPhone The App Is Called Safari. You made
it.](http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/23/apple-iphone-pornography-ban/)" by [MG
Siegler](http://mgsiegler.com/) (by the way I'm a big fan of this guy, I
really like what he writes). This article exactly reflects my point of view
concerning recent Apple's decisions. I advise you to take a look at it.
