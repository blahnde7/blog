*I hope you like The Beatles! ;)*

That's it, I'm finally tired of iTunes. On my MacBookPro, it takes close to
3 minutes to cold start, and I see the spinning ball each time I click on its
window. Such a pain! I needed to find a solution, quickly (well, I'm of those
guys who don't know how to live without music). I gently  asked Google, then
I discovered... [Songbird](http://www.getsongbird.com/)!

No lag, everything is smooth. Let's dig a bit more. In the menu bar, I found
that:

What the... ? Well, a Firefox-like console in a music player? I thought it was
an easter-egg. I closed it then I opened the preferences window, and I found...

A Firefox-like extension window! Wow, it looked like Songbird and Firefox are
cut from the same cloth. But it's not the end! I then discovered the
built-in... **browser**!

So, I have a Firefox/Gecko with a music player on top. It really came out of
left field. What else? Remember, I left iTunes only because of its bad
performances. Hopefully, Songbird has a lot of iTunes' features:

Furthermore, I really prefer its miniplayer over iTunes':

As you may have noticed, Songbird is, because of its Firefox foundation, highly
customizable. So if you, like my, prefer a lighter skin, then just download it
through the built-in browser! Here is the Gonzo 2.0 theme I chose:

So for me, slow and not customizable music players are all water under the
bridge.
