**Note: If you think that I missed a really nice disctration-less text editor,
or that one of my comment is groundless, feel free to drop me an email.**

Competitors:

 - Ommwriter
 - Pyroom
 - WriteRoom
 - JDarkroom


## Ommwriter

[Ommwriter](http://www.ommwriter.com/) is developed because of an internal need
at [Herraiz Soto & Co](http://www.herraizsoto.com/), a digital creative agency.

I like to call it the "Zen" editor, because of its default background images
and ambiance musics: they all bring the belief of
[zen](http://www.madore.org/~david/zen/) out by subtle, "quiet" images and
sounds.

It runs fast: instant launch, easy switch between applications (for
a dictionary search for example).

It really takes it promise of being a distraction-less text editor.

The full interface is clean that's true. Buttons are explicits, the scrollbar
is thin but really efficient. Nice.

## Pyroom

I put it there only because I know it exists and because [a really nice French
guy](http://jehaisleprintemps.net/blog/en/) works on it.

Here is the (huge) problem: it is such a pain to install Pyroom on OS X that
all urge to use it leaves me instantaneously.

## WriteRoom

[WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) is a $25 software
created by [Hog Bay Software](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/). It seems that is
name is like a reference in the world of distraction free text editors on OS X.

I do not really like to pay software, except if they are so nice that I can't
do without. Fortunately, I received WriteRoom in my
[MacHeist](http://www.macheist.com/) bundle a few months ago.

WriteRoom is really customizable: this is a great point for it. You can indeed
set everything from the fullscreen colors to the auto-save frequency.

In addition, it can create two types of documents: plain text and rich text,
which can be a really useful feature for people who need text formatting
without markup syntax (such as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/), I highly
recommend it). For example, using the rich text mode allows you to set color,
font weight and many other attributes such as text alignment of your text.
WriteRoom produces RTF compliant files so they are editable by any other RTF
editor.

I don't use this function because of two things. The first is that I have an
heavy use of Markdown. The second is that I think this feature is out of
distraction-less text editing.

One more thing I do not really like is that you need to move your mouse cursor
to the bottom left corner of the screen to display informations on your
document (file name, words and lines numbers). I prefer the behavior of
Ommwriter: you just move your mouse (it is equivalent for me to a light gentle
touch on my trackpad) and those informations appears.

## JDarkroom

![JDarkroom OSX integration

To be frank: I **hate** it. Firstly, it is made with Java. It is not that
I dislike Java, but it leads to problems: slow performances (it is long to
start, not really swinging) and bad system integration (does not totally hide
when I press +tab, keeps other applications from taking focus...) mainly.

![Another JDarkRoom fail

Furthermore it doesn't deal nice with UTF-8. For example, I opened and saved my
document in JDarkroom, without modifications. Here is the result back in
Ommwriter:

(Trust me, I don't let my 2400 bauds modem write my documents)

## Conclusion

To conclude, I have a preference for Ommwriter because of the real simplicity
of its look & feel. I also enjoy its ambiance songs! :)

*Note: for each editor, I used it to write the corresponding paragraph.*
