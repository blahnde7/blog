title: Convex hull algorithm in Ocaml
layout: post
---

I had to write a simple [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/) program for school which
compute the [convex hull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a finite
number of points in the plane. I decided to implement the [monotone
chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms#Algorithms)
algorithm, and then I wrote a simple GUI to display the points and the hull.

Any comment appreciated!

*Note: I also added the Makefile I have used to compile the program.*
