(Prefer [Instagram](http://instagr.am/) to Flickr? Give the excellent
[Samrat Man Singh](http://whyhello.im/samrat)'s
[Instamator](http://instamator.ep.io/) a try!)

It has been quite a long time I have not posted here, mainly because I do not
have enough time and because I prefer quality posts over quickly written
drafts.

However I take some time today to introduce
[Flickmator](http://flickmator.heroku.com/), a pretty simple web service I just
launched. Its goal is to produce some normalized data feeds about your [Flickr
favorites](http://www.flickr.com/help/favorites/), so as to allow you to make
the most of them.

I coded it very quickly ([see
here](http://flickmator.heroku.com/behind/the/scene/)) because I *needed* it.
I indeed wanted to use my Flickr favorites (which grown up thanks to / because
of [Viewfinder](http://viewfinder.io/)) as both my iMac wallpaper and screen
saver. Though some tools already exists, all those solutions feel quite "hacky"
to me, from a client point of view. Let me elaborate on this idea.

Let's imagine I own a thousand computers (and they are all OS X based, because
I know it has a **built-in** support of RSS feeds has background wallpaper),
and I want my Flickr favorites on their desktops. I would have to install
a third party software on each of them, then configure it, many times. Continue
imagining: I am happy with this solution for a few months. But the developer of
the software I installed just published a new version which contains some bug
fixes and stability improvements... What am I going to do? You get the idea.

Now do some generalization job: "I" is actually an unknown number of people
round the world, and the Flickr favorites thing is any data consumption case.

My point is, I think services should offer many diversified ways to allow their
users to deal with their data the way they want to. Firstly it would create
a sound relation between the two sides and secondly it could encourage people
to create incredible new side-products and create a pleasant ecosystem around
the initial service; which would be rather exciting don't you think?
