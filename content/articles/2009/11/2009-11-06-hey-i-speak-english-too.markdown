Or at least I try to. I know my English skills are neither really impressive nor even high. I think I am likely to make progress by practicing. In fact, I hope using English each time I write on the Web will be more efficient than writing every month at school a 300 words long text about poverty or inequalities (or any subject I have nothing to say about). So please, English users, don't hesitate to pick holes in my posts!

Language is not the only change. As some of you may have noticed, "Kiznet" is now titled "Thomas Pelletier" (far more serious right?) and I put back the "<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/journalist">Journalist</a>" theme (which is smarter than the old one). Oh, one last change: the domain name has become <a href="http://thomas.pelletier.im/">thomas.pelletier.im</a> instead of <a href="http://kiznet.fr">kiznet.fr</a>. Please update your bookmarks!

(Blogger Tip) Have you ever tried <a class="zem_slink" title="Zemanta" rel="homepage" href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>? It's a freaking awesome tool which analyses texts and displays useful related informations (such as Wiki links, photos from Flickr and keywords).
