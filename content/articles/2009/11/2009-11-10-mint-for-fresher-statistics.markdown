Four days ago I finally bought <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, for pelletier.im. I used to use <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">Wordpress' plug-in</a> for my weblog and <a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a> for all my other projects. I decided to get rid of Wordpress' plug-in because of its lack of flexibility and its heavy use of Flash. I didn't want to come back Analytics because its far too slow: it's really annoying! Lots of people advised me to use Mint. Well, I was really reluctant to spend $30 for a web-based software bound to a specific domain name. But I have got a brainwave and picked up my calculator and realised that $30 equals €20. Mint became more affordable just like that!

Mint is now running on thomas.pelletier.im! Great. Here is what I like and what I don't really love with it:
<h3>Strength</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Really easy to install. Just set up your database (with your fancy shell script which uses mysql-client — or if you are less geeky just visit your Phpmyadmin page), copy Mint onto your server and magic happens.</li>
	<li>Flexible : Mint comes with few peppers (modules), but you just have to go to the <a href="http://haveamint.com/peppermill/">Peppermill</a>, download, copy and install some of them and your Mint gets empowered by more magic powers!</li>
	<li>Realtime : refresh your page (or use a pepper which will do such a nasty task for you) and see your statistics: you don't have to wait 1 hour or anything else.</li>
	<li><a href="http://shauninman.com">Shaun Inman</a> is very nice and you will never feel alone on <a href="http://haveamint.com/forum/">Mint's forum</a>.</li>
	<li>You have the source : if something in Mint bothers you, just load your favourite text editor and go beat some PHP lines of code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Peppers aren't archived in the Peppermill: I'm looking for <a href="http://www.sensoryoutput.com/projects/freshview/">FreshView</a>, but as you can see the original website is off and I don't manage to grab the pepper.</li>
	<li>You can't display statistics for a chosen sub-domain.</li>
	<li>You can't tweak the way anonymous users see your Mint page: they can see it, or they can't.</li>
</ul>
To put it in a nutshell, Mint is really awesome and I don't regret buying it but I think I'll need to hack a bit to get rid of this sub-domain limit.
