This website is a set of static HTML pages and assets generated using
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), with nifty syntactical highlights by
[Pygments](http://pygments.org/) and a few style sheets created with
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). I also use a little hack described in
a [dedicated post](/2012/02/switching-to-nanoc/) to edit the content directly on
GitHub, usually to fix a couple of typos.

It is served by an [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) instance on my
[Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) machine which runs on the [Rackspace
cloud](http://www.rackspacecloud.com/1333-0-3-3.html). I also use
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a caching proxy in order to reduce
the strain on the Rackspace instance and the used bandwidth (yes, technology
choices driven by greed).

All the text-based edition is done with ease thanks to
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and a [customized
configuration](https://github.com/pelletier/dotfiles/tree/master/vim). Feel free
to take a look, learn and copy!

The tool set used to be really heavier, however I really strive for simplicity
on this project. If you have any ideas or sugestions, please shout! You can find
my email adress in the footer of every pages of this website.
