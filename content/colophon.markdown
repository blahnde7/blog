title: Colophon

This website is a set of static HTML pages and assets generated using
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), with nifty syntactical highlights by
[Pygments](http://pygments.org/) and a few style sheets created with
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).

It is served by an [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) instance on my
[Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) machine which runs on the [Rackspace
cloud](http://www.rackspacecloud.com/1333-0-3-3.html).

All the text-based thing is done with ease thanks to [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
and a [customized
configuration](https://github.com/pelletier/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) (based on
[Steve Losh's](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/90a02d85b468/vim/)).

My work flow is deeply based on my
[Wo](https://github.com/pelletier/wo),
[Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) to automate specific
tasks, [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) for source control,
[Hg-Git](http://hg-git.github.com/) for [Git](http://git-scm.com/) redundancy
and finally [Hg-publishall](https://bitbucket.org/pelletier/hg-publishall/) to
keep them synced.

That is a quite heavy tool set for such a modest website, but I enjoy working
with nice software, and IT is a hobby for me, so time I spend playing with it
*must* be somehow entertaining.
